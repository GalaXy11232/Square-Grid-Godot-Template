# Square Grid Template (IN GODOT GAMES)
Don't think this template is for literally every game engine. It's just for Godot...

And don't think this is like a very professional grid. It's just made of a lot of lines, that can end somewhere and the game may be bugged.

**Basically if you want to make a performant [square-grid-game?], don't really use this template.**
